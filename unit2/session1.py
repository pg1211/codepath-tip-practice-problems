Captain Blackbeard has a treasure map with several clues that point to
different locations on an island. Each clue is associated with a specific
location and the number of treasures buried there. Given a dictionary
treasure_map where keys are location names and values are integers
representing the number of treasures buried at those locations, write a
function total_treasures() that returns the total number of treasures buried on the island.

Taken captive, Captain Anne Bonny has been smuggled a secret message 
from her crew. She will know she can trust the message if it contains 
all of the letters in the alphabet. Given a string message containing 
only lowercase English letters and whitespace, write a function 
can_trust_message() that returns True if the message contains every 
letter of the English alphabet at least once, and False otherwise.

Captain Feathersword has found another pirate's buried treasure, 
but they suspect it's booby-trapped. The treasure chest has a secret 
code written in pirate language, and Captain Feathersword believes 
the trap can be disarmed if the code can be balanced. A balanced code is 
one where the frequency of every letter present in the code is equal. 
To disable the trap, Captain Feathersword must remove exactly one letter 
from the message. Help Captain Feathersword determine if it's possible to 
remove one letter to balance the pirate code.

Given a 0-indexed string code consisting of only lowercase English letters, 
write a function is_balanced() that returns True if it's possible to remove 
one letter so that the frequency of all remaining letters is equal, and False otherwise.
